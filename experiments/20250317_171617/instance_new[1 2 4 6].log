Given a list of numbers, propose all possible next steps using basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Each step must involve exactly two numbers from the list, and the result should replace those two numbers in a new list.

Rules:
- Only use basic arithmetic operations.
- Each operation should be displayed in the format: 
number operation number = result (left: updated list)
- List each possible next step on a separate line.

Example:

Input:  1 2 3
All possible next steps:
1 + 2 = 3 (left: 3 3)
1 - 2 = -1 (left: -1 3)
1 * 2 = 2 (left: 2 3)
1 / 2 = 0.5 (left: 0.5 3)
1 + 3 = 4 (left: 2 4)
1 - 3 = -2 (left: -2 2)
1 * 3 = 3 (left: 2 3)
1 / 3 = 0.33 (left: 0.33 2)
2 + 1 = 3 (left: 3 3)
2 - 1 = 1 (left: 1 3)
2 * 1 = 2 (left: 2 3)
2 / 1 = 2.0 (left: 2.0 3)
2 + 3 = 5 (left: 1 5)
2 - 3 = -1 (left: -1 1)
2 * 3 = 6 (left: 1 6)
2 / 3 = 0.67 (left: 0.67 1)
3 + 1 = 4 (left: 2 4)
3 - 1 = 2 (left: 2 2)
3 * 1 = 3 (left: 2 3)
3 / 1 = 3.0 (left: 2 3.0)
3 + 2 = 5 (left: 1 5)
3 - 2 = 1 (left: 1 1)
3 * 2 = 6 (left: 1 6)
3 / 2 = 1.5 (left: 1 1.5)

Now, generate all the possible next steps for the following input:

Input: 1 2 4 6
All possible next steps:
There is a solution and the model did not found it.
